# alx-backend-caching_property_listings
This project implements a Django-based property listing application with Redis caching at multiple levels. The system demonstrates various caching strategies including view-level caching, low-level queryset caching, and proper cache invalidation techniques. Uses Docker to containerize PostgreSQL for data persistence and Redis for caching.
